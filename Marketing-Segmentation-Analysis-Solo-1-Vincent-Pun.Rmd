## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

questions 24, 25, 26 are attitudinal variables, sbquestions with numeric responses (beliefs ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree)
since these can ultimately be averaged, they are extracted to see if they are all relevant data

Pearson Correlation 
With the visual help of a correlation plot, we see that there are certain questions that can be grouped together based on their similarity.

Question 24 - Tech Savviness 12 to 4 features 
Grouping similar questions: 

1, 2, 3, 5, 6 ->  positive attitude towards technology 

7,8 -> music/TV

10, 11 -> Internet/Communications

4, 9, 12 ->  negative aspects of technology (so theres some red in the corr plot)

Question 25 - Leadership 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ->  Leadership 

7,8 -> Control

9, 10, 11 -> Drive

6, 12 ->  negative 

Question 26 - Shopping 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ->  bargain 
8, 9, 10 -> show off
11 -> children
12, 13, 14 -> hot
15, 16, 17, 18 ->  brand

PC2 9.5%
PC3 5.4% 

Biplot of an initial attempt at PCA for market segmentation scheme 
Questions on the variable loading arrows in red, and gain insight into the areas where respones cluster (as dense areas of observation points)
Chart would be more useful if aggregated by clusters 

Pg 203 

arrows show best fit of each of the variables on the principal components 
a projection of variables onto the 2 dimensional space of first two PCA components 
explains large part of variation of data 
Inspect because direction and angle reflects the relationship of the variables
closer angle indicates higher positive association, while the relative direciotn indicates positive or negative association of the variables 

the biplot helps from the fact that the components are uncorrelated
this helps disperse the data on the chart because the x adn y axes are independent

my.pca <- prcomp(numsub)
summary(my.pca)

Chapman - Pg 305 - 11.3.2 
Groups observations according to similarity 
Distance-based algorithm operates on a dissimilarity matrix, a N by N matrix
Reports a metric for the distance between each pair of observations 
Each observation begins in its own cluster, then joins neighboring observations according to distances until all observations are linked 
Agglomerative Method = repeatedly joining observations

The silhouette width, s(i), is defined as: s(i) ranges between −1 and 1. Values near 1 indicate that object i is much closer to the other objects in the same cluster than to objects of the second closest cluster, implying a correct classification.
